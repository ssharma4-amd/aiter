# GLM-5.3 IQ2R MoE on gfx950

`aiter/iq2r_glm53.py` runs the GLM-5.3 routed experts (256 routed + the
shared expert fused as expert 256, top-9, hidden 6144) from 2-bit IQ2R
weights on MI355X, at TP4 (`inter_dim` 512) and TP8 (`inter_dim` 256).

## Layout

`iq2r_glm53_pack` converts the generic per-expert IQ2R records into one
packed stack per layer: the gate/up rows are interleaved in quads and the
codebook signs are folded into the records. The packed stack is the only
copy kept on the GPU. A checkpoint stored in this layout can be sliced to
any supported TP rank with contiguous slices (`iq2r_glm53_slice_gate`, and
the generic `iq2r_slice_*` helpers for down and aux).

## Building the checkpoint

Three tools turn the block-FP8 GLM-5.3 checkpoint and an importance
calibration file into the packed checkpoint ATOM serves. The calibration
file is an `iq2r-calibration` artifact (diagonal E[x^2] per
routed expert and per shared expert, `iq2r-diagonal-second-moment`). Its
capture runs outside aiter.

1. `aiter.iq2r_glm5_compile` encodes the routed experts of layers 3-77, plus
   the shared expert fused as expert 256, into per-layer IQ2R shards. It runs
   on the GPU, and the layers can be split across GPUs:

       SLICES=(3-12 13-22 23-32 33-42 43-51 52-60 61-69 70-77)
       for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7; do
         python3 -m aiter.iq2r_glm5_compile --model-dir $FP8 \
             --output-dir build/part$i --calibration-cache calibration.pt \
             --device cuda:$i --layers ${SLICES[$i]} --fuse-shared-expert \
             --iterations 4 --sample-vectors 65536 --resume &
       done; wait

   Link all 150 `iq2r-layer-*.safetensors` shards into one `$COMPILED`
   directory. Then rerun with `--layers 3-77 --resume` on one GPU; this
   validates every shard against the calibration file without re-encoding.
2. `aiter.iq2r_overlay` writes a model directory in the generic IQ2R layout.
   It links the compiled shards and the FP8 shards, indexes the compiled
   tensors in place of the FP8 experts and writes a config with
   `quantization_config`:

       python3 -m aiter.iq2r_overlay --model-dir $FP8 \
           --compiled-iq2r-dir $COMPILED --output-dir $OVERLAY

3. `aiter.iq2r_glm53_pack_checkpoint` writes the self-contained packed
   checkpoint (`iq2r_layout` = `glm53-packed-v1`). The `iq2r` stage runs
   `iq2r_glm53_pack` on each layer on the GPU. `base` re-shards the
   non-expert tensors, and `meta` writes the index, config and tokenizer:

       for p in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7; do
         HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$p python3 -m aiter.iq2r_glm53_pack_checkpoint \
             $OVERLAY $PACKED iq2r --part $p --parts 8 &
       done; wait
       python3 -m aiter.iq2r_glm53_pack_checkpoint $OVERLAY $PACKED base
       python3 -m aiter.iq2r_glm53_pack_checkpoint $OVERLAY $PACKED meta

On 8 MI355X GPUs the compile and pack take about 10 minutes. The result is
about 235 GB and loads at any supported TP width with no load-time
relayout.

## Dispatch

`iq2r_glm53_moe_out` looks up the launch choice for the token count in
`aiter/configs/iq2r_glm53_tuned.csv` (keyed on gfx, cu_num, token,
model_dim, inter_dim, expert, topk). Token counts without a row use
`_default_config`. `AITER_LOG_TUNED_CONFIG=1` logs every hit. Each row
names:

- the gate kernel (`decode`, `nobarrier`, `prefill`) and its grid;
- the down kernel (`route9`, `single`, `packed`, `ordered`, `prefill`) and its grid;
- the number of prefill down chunks.

`AITER_CONFIG_IQ2R_GLM53` points the lookup at a different CSV. To tune
new shapes, add them to `iq2r_glm53_untuned.csv` and run

    python3 csrc/kernels/iq2r/iq2r_glm53_tune.py \
        -i aiter/configs/iq2r_glm53_untuned.csv \
        -o aiter/configs/iq2r_glm53_tuned.csv

## Results

ATOM serving on MI355X, `benchmark_serving`, OSL 1024, 10 prompts per
concurrency, FP8 KV cache, CUDA graphs, no IQ2R environment variables.
Both arms quantize the non-expert layers online to PTPC FP8. MXFP4 is
stock ATOM with the routed experts quantized online to MXFP4. IQ2R loads
the packed IQ2R experts. Output tokens/s:

The tuner times each candidate by CUDA graph replay, as serving runs it;
eager timing adds host overhead that hides the best small-M launches. The
decode kernels accept up to 1024 tokens so the CSV can choose them for MTP
verify batches, which are (1 + speculative tokens) x concurrency.

## Tests

`op_tests/test_iq2r_glm53.py` checks the packed path against a dense Torch
reference (device-materialized weights, MXFP8 activations, BF16 SiLU·up) for
M = 1..3000 at both TP widths, the chunked long prefill, that packing commutes
with TP slicing, and the tuned CSV lookup. `op_tests/test_iq2r_hip.py` checks
the device encoder and materializer bit-exactly against the host reference.
`op_tests/test_iq2r_glm5_compile.py`, `test_iq2r_overlay.py` and
`test_iq2r_glm53_pack_checkpoint.py` cover the three checkpoint tools.
