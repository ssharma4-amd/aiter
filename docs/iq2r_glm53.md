# GLM-5.3 IQ2R MoE on gfx950

`aiter/iq2r_glm53.py` runs the GLM-5.3 routed experts (256 routed + the
shared expert fused as expert 256, top-9, hidden 6144) from 2-bit IQ2R
weights on MI355X, at TP4 (`inter_dim` 512) and TP8 (`inter_dim` 256).

## Layout

`iq2r_glm53_pack` converts the generic per-expert IQ2R records into one
packed stack per layer: the gate/up rows are interleaved in quads and the
codebook signs are folded into the records. The packed stack is the only
copy kept on the GPU. A checkpoint stored in this layout can be sliced to
any supported TP rank with contiguous slices (`iq2r_glm53_slice_gate`, and
the generic `iq2r_slice_*` helpers for down and aux).

## Dispatch

`iq2r_glm53_moe_out` looks up the launch choice for the token count in
`aiter/configs/iq2r_glm53_tuned.csv` (keyed on gfx, cu_num, token,
model_dim, inter_dim, expert, topk). Token counts without a row use
`_default_config`. `AITER_LOG_TUNED_CONFIG=1` logs every hit. Each row
names:

- the gate kernel (`decode`, `nobarrier`, `prefill`) and its grid;
- the down kernel (`route9`, `packed`, `ordered`, `prefill`) and its grid;
- the number of prefill down chunks.

`AITER_CONFIG_IQ2R_GLM53` points the lookup at a different CSV. To tune
new shapes, add them to `iq2r_glm53_untuned.csv` and run

    python3 csrc/kernels/iq2r/iq2r_glm53_tune.py \
        -i aiter/configs/iq2r_glm53_untuned.csv \
        -o aiter/configs/iq2r_glm53_tuned.csv

## Results

ATOM serving on MI355X, `benchmark_serving`, OSL 1024, 10 prompts per
concurrency, FP8 KV cache, CUDA graphs, no IQ2R environment variables.
Both arms quantize the non-expert layers online to PTPC FP8. MXFP4 is
stock ATOM with the routed experts quantized online to MXFP4. IQ2R loads
the packed IQ2R experts. Output tokens/s:

A rerun of the tuner reproduces the TP4 rows to within 0.6%. For TP8 it
picks different launches at some token counts (up to 4.9% faster in
isolation), but serving with those rows is within noise of the committed
CSV (−4.1% at C16, +2.3% at C64, within 1% elsewhere), so the committed rows
are kept.

## Tests

`op_tests/test_iq2r_glm53.py` checks the packed path against a dense Torch
reference (device-materialized weights, MXFP8 activations, BF16 SiLU·up) for
M = 1..3000 at both TP widths, the chunked long prefill, that packing commutes
with TP slicing, and the tuned CSV lookup. `op_tests/test_iq2r_hip.py` checks
the device encoder and materializer bit-exactly against the host reference.

## Producing a checkpoint

Checkpoint production is offline. `aiter/iq2r_glm5_compile.py` encodes the
GLM-5.3 FP8 routed and shared experts to generic IQ2R records (gate/up
interleaved; pass `--fuse-shared-expert` to append the shared expert as
expert 256, which the packed path requires); `iq2r_glm53_pack` then
re-lays the full-width TP1 stack into the packed layout, which ATOM slices to
TP4 or TP8 at load time.
